# Distinguishing Between UI and UX
Simple definition:

- When people say __UI__, they usually mean everything related to graphic design, colors, fonts, backgrounds, buttons, stock photos, icons etc.
- When people say __UX__, they usually mean tasks related to psychology, human decision making, user research, personas, user stories, workflows, A/B testing, statistical evaluation and so on.

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface Designer Roadmap

User Interface (UI) design is the process of creating the visual elements and interactive features of a digital product, such as a website, mobile app, or software application. The primary goal of UI design is to enhance the user's experience by making the product visually appealing, easy to use, and efficient in achieving its purpose. UI design encompasses various elements that users interact with on the screen, including buttons, icons, images, text, forms, and other interactive components.
The tools of the trade for UI design are mainly [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/experience-design.html), [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html). Some UI designers also code HTML and CSS at work.

## ðŸ”® User Experience Roadmap

User Experience (UX) design is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on creating products, systems, or services that are user-centric and provide a positive and meaningful experience for the users. The goal of UX design is to enhance user satisfaction and usability by improving the overall interaction between the user and the product. Here's a general roadmap for UX design:

Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app that works on your browser.  What does that really mean?  You can access your projects from multiple devices without installing software.  You and others can work on the same file in real-time taking the project from brainstorming to prototypes.  You can use Figma to design briefs, create storyboards, reduce complexity on web sites and even design your CV or resume all while collaborating with others in real time! By the end of this project, you will go through the steps to learn about the application to develop a web page or homepage for your own app.
## Skills covered
* Create a Figma account and learn about some of the main features of Figma.
* Develop a plan for how to collaborate with your team, share the design and learn about the levels of access to grant in Figma.
* Add pages to the frame in Figma.
