## Distinguishing Between UI and UX
Often times, people use the terms ```UI``` and ```UX``` interchangeably. Despite some shared elements, there are notable differences. Here is a simple definition:

- When people say __UI__, they usually mean everything related to graphic design, colors, fonts, backgrounds, buttons, stock photos, icons etc.
- When people say __UX__, they usually mean tasks related to psychology, human decision making, user research, personas, user stories, workflows, A/B testing, statistical evaluation and so on.

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface Designer Roadmap
The tools of the trade for UI design are mainly [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/experience-design.html), [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html). Some UI designers also code HTML and CSS at work.

The goal of UX design is to enhance user satisfaction and usability by improving the overall interaction between the user and the product. Here's a general roadmap for UX design:
